			<h4>Out of the Forests</h4>
			<p>Like humans, apelong are varied, clever, and highly adaptable. Those that leave their troops and native jungles behind are rare enough to turn heads when encountered by the unfamiliar, and at first glance, a naked greater ape is almost indistinguishable from their beastly counterparts. This has led to more than a few unfortunate misunderstandings and members of this proud people have been kept imprisoned by charlatans and circuses who show off their talking ape as a curiosity for passing travelers.</p>
			<p class="indent">Apelong tribes are known for their making alliances and readily join ranks with other races, forming multigenerational bonds. In areas where this has happened, seeing an ape tending bar or serving as a city guard can become a regular sight. Of all other races, apes are the least likely to trust humans, who they often believe themselves superior to in every way.</p>
			<p class="indent">Apelong do not live quite as long as their human cousins, and mature and age at more rapid rates. The greater apes are divided into three distinct races: the ozo, the panzu, and the suxiu. The ozo tend to dedicate themselves to a life of duty and service, while the panzu and suxiu are more likely to take to a life of freewheeling opportunism.</p>
